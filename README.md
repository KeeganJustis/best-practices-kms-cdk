KMS Best Practices with Terraform CDK
This project demonstrates how to set up AWS Key Management Service (KMS) with best practices using Terraform CDK in TypeScript. The implementation applies object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Features
Customer-Managed Key (CMK): Create and manage your own encryption keys for sensitive workloads.
Key Rotation: Automatically enable key rotation for enhanced security.
Access Policies: Implement least privilege IAM policies for secure key access.
Alias Management: Assign meaningful aliases for easier key management.
Data Encryption: Integrate KMS keys with AWS services (e.g., S3).
Audit Logging: Enable CloudTrail for monitoring key usage.
